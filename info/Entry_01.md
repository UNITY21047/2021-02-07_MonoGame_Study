# 1 | Using MonoGame

## Setup

- Follow the MonoGame site instructions.
- Used Inkscape to create a box asset.
- Imported the asset in to the content space using the MGCB Editor; this the command for the editor, ``mgcb-editor --registor``. I then saved the import settings.
- I then followed the "Learn 2D Game Development with MonoGame" in the ``study_books`` folder.ure

## Coding
- I then proceded to import the box asset as a texture and move that texure using a vector2D struct. After those operations, I drew the texture with its postions within the Draw function using the _spriteBatch's draw function.
